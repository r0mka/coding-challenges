# Graphs

A graph data structure consists of a finite(and possibly mutable) set of vertices
or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected `graph`
or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

`Nodes` + `Connections` between those nodes

- `Vertext` - node
