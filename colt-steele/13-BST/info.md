# Tree

A data structure that consists of nodes in `parent/child` relationship.

Linked lists are `linear`. `Trees` are `non linear`

A singly linked list is a special case of a tree.

A `node` can only point to a `child`
Every node is moving away from the root node;

- `Root` - The top node in a tree.
- `Child` - A node directly connected to another node.
- `Parent` - The converse notion of a child.
- `Siblings` - A group of nodes with the same parent.
- `Leaf` - A node with no children.
- `Edge` - The connection between one node and another.

# Binary search tree

- Every parent node has at most `two` children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is `always less` than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is `always greater` than the parent
